# Raise of the Action Hero
### Keybind more, click less. Automate away holding down right click. Make WoW more like an action RPG.
## Getting Started
Several of this addons features are done through the keybindings menu.

>From the games Main Menu GoTo Keybindings -> Addons -> Raise of the Action Hero and set keybindings there.

It is also recommended to set the Blizzard binding (Target Scan Enemy) as a keybinding.

>This binding can be found in Keybindings -> Targeting -> Target Scan Enemy (Hold).

This little known targeting function targets the first enemy in front of your character. Tap a second time to go to the second. It is like Tab Targeting, but only a straight line ahead of the character instead of a cone.

TSE can also be used to target M+ Explosives instead of clicking them!

Addon author Racklinc has set TSE to the TAB key.
## More to Come
>Context keybindings that will adapt to conditions such as raidmarking, NPC gossip progress, quest reward selection.

>Keybinding to handle using usable quest items.

>Engineering enthusiast macro replacements

>Keybindings to use common items such as Healthstones, health potions, combat potions, trinkets.

>Context of Accept Rez and cast a rez.
